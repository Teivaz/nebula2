    @section NebulaInputSystemOverview Overview

    The input server is the central collection point for input events.
    Basically anyone can feed input events into or read them
    back from the global list of input events. The input server
    also maps low level input events to high level 'app events', or
    can bind the execution of script statements to input events.
