Included here is the source for nCLODTerrain, the chunked LOD terrain
implementation for The Nebula Device.

To compile, unpack into code/contrib and re-run the update.tcl script in
the Nebula root directory (typically whatever $RL_HOME is set to).
You should then see a 'chunklod' project/solution which you can compile.
Note that you also need nopende installed in contrib, since clodterrain
uses the nopende code for collision and dynamics.

The nclodterrain module is usable for linking in other programs, and
'nclododeviewer' is an example of a viewer that uses both clodterrain
and opende to bounce around a bunch of boxes.

The descriptions below assume you are in code/contrib/nclodterrain/bin, as
that is where all the relevant scripts are located.

Also, note that to run the scripts below you need to run a program that
has the nclodterrain nodes linked in!  The default 'nshlua' program
does not have the nclodterrain nodes linked in, so you will just get an
assertion error if you try to compile or view chunked LOD terrain.  There
is an example program 'nclododeviewer' that you can run to compile or
view terrain data.





In order to use a terrain, you must 'compile' it from the bitmap-based
form into a chunked vertex mesh/texture format.

***To compile the terrain:

You can compile two sorts of terrains.  Basically, they differ only in
how the texture is applied.  You can drape one huge texture over the
entire terrain (texture-mapped) or apply several small tiled detail
textures based on a "tile map" (tile-mapped)

***To compile a texture-mapped terrain:

Select your input and output files. You need as input a greyscale or RGB heightmap
and an RGB terrain texture.  The output is a tesselated mesh quadtree
(a .clod file) and a texture quadtree (a .tqt file).  I have included
an example script "compileterrain.lua" for this which is setup like:

Heightmap:   code/contrib/nclodterrain/export/textures/examples/heightfield.bmp
Texture:     code/contrib/nclodterrain/export/textures/examples/cloddiffuse.bmp

Mesh output:  code/contrib/export/terrains/examples/sample.clod
TQT output:   code/contrib/export/terrains/examples/sample.tqt

You can of course edit the script file to change these locations.

To do the compilation execute the script using nclododeviewer:
"nclododeviewer -script compileterrain.lua"


***To compile a tile-mapped terrain:

First, decide on which textures to use as your tiles.  For example, let's
use grass, dirt, rock, and water.  We'll map these to indices 0,1,2, and 3.

Select your input and output files. You need as input a greyscale or RGB heightmap
and an indexed terrain texture.  The indexed texture should contain
indexed values at each pixel to indicate which tile texture to put there. 
For instance, paint pixels with index 0 everywhere you want grass, index 1
where you want dirt, etc.
The output is a tesselated mesh quadtree (a .clod file) and a texture quadtree
(a .tqt file).  I have included an example script "compilesplatterrain.lua" for
this which is setup like:

Heightmap:   code/contrib/nclodterrain/export/textures/examples/heightfield.bmp
Texture:     code/contrib/nclodterrain/export/textures/examples/tiles.bmp
Tiles:       code/contrib/nclodterrain/export/textures/terrainsplat/{tile names}.bmp

Mesh output:  code/contrib/export/terrains/examples/sample.clod
TQT output:   code/contrib/export/terrains/examples/sample.tqt

The actual command is:
"nclododeviewer -script compilesplatterrain.lua"


***To view the resultant terrain:

To view your terrain execute
"nclododeviewer -view clod.n2"
Again, you can edit the script file clod.n2 to use other terrain files
if you want.
