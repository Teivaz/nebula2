Hello,


- extract ndotnet.zip into your nebula2 home folder, normally C:\nebula2

- add the following workspace targets to your nebula2\code\nebula2\bldfiles\n2wspace.bld file 
    
    nlangwrapperlib 
    nwrapper 
    ndotnetlib

- from the VisualStudio.Net(VS.Net) command prompt call nebula2\update.tcl

- open the nebula2\build\vstudio71\Nebula2.sln file

- inside VS.Net change the following project settings for the project ndotnetlib
  (simply right click on the ndotnetlib project folder and choose Properties from the popup menu)
  
    set: Use Managed Extensions       to: Yes
    set: Turn Off Assembly Generation to: Yes (/NOASSEMBLY)

- compile (compilation needs to be done only once since ndotnetlib source files are not autogenerated :-))

- Go to the nebula2\code\contrib\ndotnet\src\dotnet\Nebula2 folder and run the build.bat file

- Go to the nebula2\code\contrib\ndotnet\src\dotnet\Nebula2\samples folder and try the .bat files
  (You may also look at the sources there)


Have fun,

Perfect Cell
