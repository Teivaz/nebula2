Except as noted, all graphics files (.dds, .n3d2, .psys, .bmp, .nanim) in this (objects) directory and its subdirectories are (c) 2004 Gryphon Arts (Christian Kleinsteinberg).
You may use them in conjunction with noncommercial use of the Bombsquad Bruce game, as long as this notice is preserved, but that's it: 
you may not sell Bombsquad Bruce (with these graphics), you may not incorporate these graphics into your own projects, display them on your web page, etc.
