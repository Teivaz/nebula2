Megan Fox's PhysDemo

'1' - creates a block
'2' - creates a small sphere
'3' - creates a big sphere
'4' - creates a stack of blocks (in a neato flashy way)

'6' - drops a block from the camera's position
'7' - drops a sphere from the camera's position
'8' - creates a block stack at the position under the camera

'p' - (very dangerous) creates an entire row (or two) of stacked blocks straight across the floor, using the camera's position as a reference.  This can very easily bring your system to a griding halt, so be ready to explode the boxes away.

'0' - creates an explosion, useful for clearing away a pile of objects.

'spacebar' - fires a super-massive bullet from the camera in the direction the camera is looking


Any objects falling significantly below the floor plate will be destroyed, so if the system starts lagging (and it will if you make a pile of too many blocks/etc), hit explosion a few times and send the objects hogging your system to their doom.


Have fun!
