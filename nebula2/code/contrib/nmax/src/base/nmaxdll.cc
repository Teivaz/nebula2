/**
    To make plugin Classes like a ExporterClass to Max it's required:
    - to create a class description by inherit from ClassDesc
    - you must count the number of ClassDesc you want to publish to Max, returned in LibNumberClasses()
    - you must return a pointer to an instance of the right inherited ClassDesc in LibClassDesc(int i).

    The common solution for this task is:
    - create a inherited ClassDesc's for each Class and a static instance of this
    - count the number of classes you will to pulish to in the plugin and update
    the return value for LibNumberClasses()
    - update LibClassDesc(int i) to return the right instances adress

    Bads:
    - done as parts of the code, so all is static
    - request a special maxdll-header for every plugin you create
     with adapted functions (LibNumberClasses, LibClassDesc)
    - requires to change 3-4 parts in you code if you add or remove a class for the export
    to max
    - can not adjusted dynamic

    A 'better' solution:
    - the inherited ClassDecs's is created with the template
    tRegisteredClassDesc<class TYPE> and must only a static instance must be created.
    So you have only two lines code that defines all you need to know about this tasks
    - the linkedClassDesc is parrent for all the individual ClassDesc's created in step 1.
    All instances of linkedClassDesc share a nArray and in the Consturctoe they regiester
    themself in this nArray (Because all instances of them are defined static, the call to
    the contructor is done automatic while loading the dll, so all required information
    is pressent before the _any_ method can be called on this dll)
    The number of ClassDesc in this plugin so is automatic evaluated during the init of the static
    members and is equal to size of the nArray.
    - Because every linkedClassDesc push ther 'this'-pointer to the array it is easy to get the right
    adresses of the instance.

    Goods:
    - count and get the right instance adresses is done automatic
    - easy add or remove of classes you like to export to max
    - only one generic maxplugin dllheader for all plugins you like to create

    Bads:
    - in the moment there is a bug (only worked around, not fixed)
    all static variables are initiated two times,
    at differnt adresses. It's not clear if this is a bug of my code,
    or a bug in the linker or something else. If you have a idea about this please
    notify me, to inspect the bug see part2 of the constructor below.
    A workaround of this bug is that I compare the Class_ID of all instances and only register
    uniqes.
