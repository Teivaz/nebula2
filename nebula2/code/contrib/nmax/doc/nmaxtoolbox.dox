    This section of the documentation provides technical information on the  
    <b>Nebula 3DS Max Toolkit</b>(aka. <tt>nmaxtoolbox</tt>) which used to create   
    contents and tools with 3DS Max.

    @section NMAXToolBoxOverview Overview

    The <b>Nebula 3DS Max Toolkit</b> is a 3DS Max plugin dll. 
    If you're not familiar with the programming of the 3DS Max plugin, it is highly
    recommended to read the 3DS Max SDK help file provided when the 3DS Max SDK is
    installed.

    @note
    If you want to see the features of the toolkit and supported 3DS Max features 
    or usages of the toolkit, see the toolkit manual which provides for the artists.
    The toolkit manual can be found on <tt>$nebula2/code/contrib/nmax/doc/artistdoc</tt>

    A common way to start to write a 3DS Max plugin is to use SDK appwizard shipped and
    provided by 3DS Max SDK. But the Nebula provides its own libarary and classes 
    which are more easy to use than the appwizard of the SDK.
    You should use this feature to write a 3DS Max plugin for Nebula.
    See @ref registeredClassDesc for more details and its usages.

    @section NMaxToolBoxComponents Components of the Toolkit

    The toolkit consists of the followings for its components:

        - <b>Exporter</b> - 3DS Max exporter plugin for Nebula.
        - <b>Nebula Script Function Expose System</b> - plugin written based on 3DS Max 
          Function Publishing System which enables to call Nebula script commands via MaxScript.
        - <b>Max Script Generator</b> - plugin which generates max script based on the given
          Nebula object.


    @section NMAXToolBoxInstallation Building the Plugin

    nMaxToolBox was targeted at 3DS Max 6 or its higher versions. 
    (though the toolkit has been mainly developed on 3DS Max 7).

    When you develop a 3DS Max plug-ins, it is important to choose a
    proper compiler:

        - Microsoft Visual C++ 6 (VC 6) : It is not recommended.
        - Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2002 (VC 7.0) : Recommended for 3DS Max 6.
        - Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2003 (VC 7.1) : Recommended for 3DS Max 7.    
    
    @note
    There are link errors when nmaxtoolbox is built with 3ds max6 and vc7.1
    on release mode.  The error is caused by memory management incompatibility
    between the various versions of the Microsoft compilers, but it cannot
    be smoothly solved even with <tt>&lt;MAX_Mem.h&gt;</tt> which has been
    provided by Discreet as a solution to that problem, at the moment. So it
    is highly recommended to use VC 7.0 if you use 3DS Max 6.0.

    The following list shows the steps of building the plugin:

      -# Run @c update.tcl(or @c update.py) to generate workspace.
      -# Add the path of the 3DS Max SDK headers and libraries to your VC
         Project Directories.
      -# Build the plugin package and copy it to <tt>$3dsmax\\plugins</tt> directory.
        - Generated plugin file, @b nmaxtoolbox.dlu can be found in 
          <tt>$nebula2/bin/win32</tt> or <tt>$nebula2/bin/win32d</tt> directory 
          depending on your compile mode.
      -# Run 3DS Max.
        - copied plugin will automatically be loaded when you start up 3DS Max.


    @section NMAXToolBoxDebugging Debugging the Plugin

    There is two way to debug the plugin. One for startup of the plugin and 
    the other for exporting of the plugin.

      - Open <i>Project Setting</i>. 
      - Under <i>Configuration Properties</i> select <i>Debugging</i>.
        - Set <i>Command</i> to point to <tt>3dsmax.exe</tt>.(which is found in the directory 
          where you intalled 3dsmax. i.e. <tt>c:/3dsmax7/3dsmax.exe</tt>)

    The above is useful when you debug and see what happens when the 3dsmax loads 
    the plugin. But with this, you can't debug exporting of the plugin.
    So there is other way to debug the plugin which enables you to debug process of exporing.

     - First, set break point where you want to debug.
     - Select <i>Debug</i> menu and click <i>Process</i> menu item.
     - This will bring the <i>Process</i> dialog. 
       - Select <tt>3dsmax.exe</tt> in the list view and click <i>Connect</i> button. 
         - It brings the dialog which shows the list of programs to debug.
         - Select 'Native' then click 'Ok' and close the process dialog.
     - Start to export and the debugger will stop where you set the break point.

    Now, you can set break point wherever you want to stop and debug the process of exporting.


    @section NMAXToolBoxAdditionalNotes Additional Notes 

    The <b>Nebula2 3DS Max Toolkit</b> was written on the native 3DS Max SDK not 
    IGame library which provided by Discreet for easy writing of exporter. 
    (previous Nebula2 3dsmax exporter was written based on the IGame libararay)
    The reason that the toolkit does not uses IGame libarary is that the library has some bugs
    and it is not regularly updated and it is nothing more than the wrapper of the exsiting SDK.
    So, for the reasons of those, the <b>Nebula2 3DS Max Toolkit</b> was written based on the 
    native 3DS Max SDK which provided when the 3DS Max is installed.
