    @section NMaxHowtoHierarchyNodeOverview Overview

    A toolkit plugin allows to export mesh nodes of a scene in a hierarchy 
    form using <i>Group</i> or <i>Linking</i> command of 3DSMax.

    
    @section NMaxHowtoHierarchyNodeUsage Usage

    Let's look how the toolkit plugin will export groupped or linked objects 
    of a scene.

    @subsection NMaxHowtoHierarchyNodeGroup Groupping Objects

    You might want to group several objects to make them a single group.

    The following image shows a group of two objects, <i>'box01'</i> and 
    <i>'box02'</i> in a schematic view:

    @image html hierarchy01.png "Groupped objects in a schematic view"

    The toolkit plugin will create <tt>ntransformnode</tt> for group object
    and generate the hierarchy like the following when it exports:
@verbatim
    ntransformnode group01
     |
     +- nshapenode box01
     |
     +- nshapenode box02
@endverbatim

     Groupped objects will be located under the group object as same level 
     if there are no links between objects.

    @note
    The ohter case which the toolkit plugin places <tt>ntransformnode</tt>
    on the top of the several <tt>nshapenode</tt> is that the object has 
    <i>Mulit-sub</i> material. See @ref NMaxHowtoMEditorMultiSubMaterials 
    for the details.

    @subsection NMaxHowtoHierarchyNodeLink Linking Objects
    
    You might want to create links to build the hierarchy between nodes.
    You can make it by clicking <i>'Select And Link'</i> on the toolbar
    or <i>'Connect'</i> on the toolbar of a schematic view either.

    The following image shows two linked objects, <i>'box01'</i> and 
    <i>'sphere01'</i> in a schematic view:

    @image html hierarchy02.png "Linked objects in a schematic view"

    The toolkit plugin will generate the hierarchy like the following
    when it exports:
@verbatim
    nshapenode box01
     |
     +- nshpaenode sphere01
@endverbatim
