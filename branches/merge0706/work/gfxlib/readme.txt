This is the graphics objects library as generated by the modelers/animators.
This gfxlib directory should contain another directory level for
'graphics object categories', which ideally only contain modelling package files. 
The batch exporter tool should be able to work itself through the gfxlib
and export the graphics objects to 'export/gfxlib'.
