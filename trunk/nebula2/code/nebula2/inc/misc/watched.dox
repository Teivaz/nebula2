    @brief Watched variables are an easy way to view data
    from the inner workings of the engine.

    There are many simple examples of the use of nWatchedVar in the
    nD3D9Server class.

    To create one, simply define one in an appropriate scope, such
    as on one a server object:

    @code
    nWatched dbgQueryNumRenderStateChanges;
    @endcode

    Then, initialize it with the name that it should use within
    the @c /sys/var directory in the NamedObjectHierarchy, as well
    as the type of the variable:

    @code
    dbgQueryNumRenderStateChanges("gfxNumRenderStateChanges", nArg::Int)
    @endcode

    Finally, update it as you need to:

    @code
    this->dbgQueryNumRenderStateChanges->SetI(this->statsNumRenderStateChanges);
    @endcode
