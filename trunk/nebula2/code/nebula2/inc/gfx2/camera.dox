    @section NebulaCameraSystemOverview Overview

    The core part of the Nebula does not provide any application specific
    camera module. 
    Though there is @ref nCamera2 class but it provides only methods to set 
    projection for othogonal or perspective either and view volume.
    It means that you should create an application specific camera module 
    for your own needs.

    See @ref nMayaCamControl class which is used for <tt>nviewer</tt> 
    application to provide a camera system similiar to what the Maya package 
    do and @ref nAppCamera class if you use @ref nApplication class for 
    your code base.
