    @section NMaxHowtoCharactersOverview Overview 

    <b>The Nebula2 Toolkit For 3DS Max</b> previews and exports smooth-skinned 3DS Max 
    characters with any number of bones, any number of skins and materials, and 
    up to 4 weights per vertex.

    Any exported characters are animated through the Nebula2 animation system which  
    supports smooth animation transitions, and weighted animation blending. 
    All transformation types (translation, rotation, scaling) are allowed on bones.

    The following list are supported toolkit features related to the character.
        - Character Studio @b Biped and @b Physique are available
        - 3DS Max <b>Skin Modifier</b> is available
        - any type of the objects can be used for bone

    @subsection NMaxHowtoCharactersMotionFlow Using Motion Flow Editor for Animation States

    Nebula2 animation system supports transitions between each of animations 
    and it is done by animation state and clip.
    You can think animation state and clip like followings:
      - <tt>Animation State</tt> - A collection of clips. A transition from one  
                   animation to another animation is done by a change of state
      - <tt>Animation Clip</tt> - An animation with a specific blend value.

    One of the easy way to make animation states is using <b>Motion Flow Editor</b> 
    which 3DSMax and Character Studio supports.

    Select any one of the biped object through <i>'Select Objects'</i> dialog. 
    (shortcut is <i>'h'</i> key)
    Select <i>'Motion Flow Modes'</i> in <i>'Motion Panel'</i> which brings up 
    <i>'Motion Flow'</i> rollout. Select <i>'Show Graph'</i> button to show up 
    <i>'Motion Flow Graph'</i> dialog.

    You can link all the separated animations you've created with the motion flow editor.  
    The Nebula 3DSMax toolkit will refer it and create needed animation states and clips 
    which are needed when the toolkit exports the character.

    @note
    See the <tt>3DSMax User Reference</tt> for more details about the 
    Motion Flow Editor and its usage.

    You can create animations states through Nebula 3DSMax toolkit animation 
    states dialog.
    Select <i>Nebula2 > Character Editor...</i> menu item, this shows up 
    <i>'Nebula2 Animation State'</i> dialog.

    Now, you can see the created animation states which corresponds to each clip of 
    the motion flow editor in <i>'Nebula2 Animation State'</i> dialog.

    The Nebula 3DSMax Toolkit only refers to the <tt>'Note Track'</tt> when
    it exports skinned animation objects.
    This means that you need to create note track to export animation states.
    The Nebula2 animation state dialog automatically generates note track for it.
    Click <i>'Create Note Track'</i> button which creates note track based on 
    the created animation states. You can see the created note track in 
    <tt>Dope sheet Track View</tt>.
    Select <i>'Graph Editors > Track View - Dope Sheet...'</i>

    The Nebula2 animation state dialog creates note track on the root biped object.
    Select the root biped object and collapse to see its note track.

    @note
    You don't need to use the motion flow editor to create animation states.
    You can manually create it by creating <tt>Note Tracks</tt>.

    The <tt>nviewer</tt> allows you to change the exported aniamtions.
    Type <tt>'esc'</tt> to show the task bar then click <tt>'Scn'</tt> icon. 
    It brings 'Scene Control' dialog and you will find the various animation states 
    shown on the 'AnimStates' listbox in the dialog. 
    You can change the current animation to click the aniamtion state item in the 
    listbox.
