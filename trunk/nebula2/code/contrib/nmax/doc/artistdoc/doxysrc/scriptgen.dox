    <i>Note: This feature of the toolkit is alpha stage at the moment.</i>

    @section NMaxScriptGenOverview Overview 

    To make a full featured game, you need tools or eidtors in addition  
    game engine. But writing tools or editors are not a simple task even
    it may takes more time than to write game eninge.
    One of the solution is to use and extend existing package such as 3DSMax 
    for the editors or tools. 
    3DSMax provides various and powerful features for those purpose via
    its custom attributes and max script. But extending 3DSMax also requires
    to write bunch of code though it does not as much as writing it from scratch.

    <b>The Auto Script Generator</b> was made to solve this problem.
    The Auto Script Generator of the toolkit automatically generates 
    max script code which contains custom attributes and UI code on the given
    Nebula2 objects.
    With this fuculty you dont have to write bunch of the code to extend 3DSMax.
    Any one of the your team member who is programmer may write code or libarary 
    with C++ for the game entities and that will have scripting interfaces
    to extend it and to be callable within script.
    (This means that the entity class will be derived from <tt>nroot</tt> class)
    The toolkit provides automatic scripting generation fuculty on any Nebula 
    objects. So you may can directly construct your entity editor within 3DSMax 
    even not to write any a line of code.
    It also helpful in the middle of the time of the project.  
    The entity system will be frequaently changed and a new entities will be 
    added either. Even some of those may be removed.  
    But that's not a problem. Any changes of the entity system can be rapidly applied
    to the editor and your artist or designer does not need to wait until the editor
    is modified. Even it may be possible to extend or construct editor by artists or
    designers not by programmers if he or she has basic knowlege about max script
    and their entity system.
    In a long term, you dont need to write or modify your editors or tools whenever
    you start a new project. Write and build entity system first and you will have
    editors or tools which you need.
 
    Auto Script Generator can be more easily used and extended with Nebula 3DSMax 
    Exposing system. See @ref NMaxHowtoExpose for the details.

        script code. <br>
        <br>
