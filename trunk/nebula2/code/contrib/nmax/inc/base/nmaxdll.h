/**
    @ingroup NebulaMaxPlugin

    This is wrapper to generate all needed functions an exports to create
    a 3ds max plugin.
    This includes linkedClassDesc for the automatic count and publish of all
    classes you like to publish to max.
    And the macro DefineLinkedClassDesc for the easy create of ClassDesc's for
    the export.

    A a instace of the nKernelServer will be created on DLL attach, and deleted 
    on DLL detach.
    Also a nMaxLoghandler is created and setted as the default loghandler for 
    the ks instance, but this LogHandler needes a pointer to the MaxInterface 
    as soon as possible.

    indicating if the class being created is going to be loaded from a disk file.
    FIXME: this is not handled:
    If the flag is TRUE, the plug-in may not have to perform any initialization 
    of the object because the loading process will take care of it. 
    See in the MAXSDK the Advanced Topics section on Loading and Saving for

    If this is set to be an existing category (i.e. "Standard Primitives", 
    "Particle Systems", etc.) then the plug-in will appear in that category.
    Developers should NOT add to the categories provided by 3ds max 
    (see the note below).
    If the category doesn't yet exist then it is created.
    If the plug-in does not need to appear in the list, it may simply return 
    a null string as in _T("").
    Category() is also used for modifiers to classify them in the button sets 
    dialog.
    Important Note: The 3ds max architecture has a limit of 12 plug-ins per 
    category in the Create branch.
    To prevent a problem with too many plug-ins per category, developers should
    ALWAYS create a new Category for their plug-ins, rather than using one of 
    the existing ones used by the standard 3ds max plug-ins.
    Note that versions of 3ds max prior to release 1.2 would crash if there were 
    more than 12 buttons per category.
