/** VisitorFlags helper struct.  This class contains a boolean flag, for specifying that a primitive is
    visible or contained or whatever.  Also within the class is a bunch of bits that be used by the visitor
    for transferring state between calls to the visitor; this is mainly use by visitors to avoid extra
    or redundant tests.  For instance, if you do a VisibilityTest() on an octtree node that is fully visible,
    then the VisitorFlags returned will contain a state that says anything contained within the octree node does
    not need further plane tests.  If you pass the returned VisitorFlags into future VisibilityTest() calls for
    child nodes of that node, the VisibilityTest()s will go much faster since the visitor can tell that it 
    doesn't need to do a full set of culling tests.

    You can of course ignore all this for simplicity and always pass in the default constructed VisitorFlags.
    The visitor should still work and return the exact same set of elements, it will just be a bit slower.  This
    can be used for fairly simple heirarchy elements or debugging scaffolding elements.

    The exact meaning of the activeflags varies with the visitor, so don't try to take the result from one visitor
    and use it in another visitor...

    Various subclasses of this abstract class are used for specific types
    of visibility culling.  To add a new type of visibility visitor:

    1. Subclass this class.  Add in stacks for any data that depends on
    the coordinate system.

    2. Override Visit() to process elements.  This will typically add the element to a list of visible
    objects, draw the visible element, or something similar.

    3. To make hierarchy objects work, override the VisibilityTest(...) methods to
    perform a proper test for the given element.

    4. To handle sectors with different coordinate systems, override
    the Enter/LeaveLocalSpace methods, such that you transform into
    the new sector space and push the new state onto your stacks.

/**
    @class nOcclusionVisitor
    @ingroup NSpatialDBContribModule
    @brief Visitor to collect occluders and provide visibility testing using those occluders.

    The OcclusionVisitor is a general visitor class that processes occluders and construct
    some sort of occlusiong representation so that it can determine if other objects
    are occluder or not.  This may be acheived by simply recording all the occluding objects
    and doing a geometrical inspection of potentially visible objects, or it may be acheive
    with occlusion maps or some other method.  The keys attributes of the occlusion visitor are:

    1. Non-compiled.  You can add an occluder, test to see if an object is occluded so far, and
    then add another occluder.  If the occlusion determination needs to compile some sort of internal
    data, it must be able to do so multiple times; there is no requirement to add all the
    occluders and then start doing occlusion tests.  This means you may need to have a flag that
    forces a recompilation of internal data structures whenever a new occluder is added.

    2. Conservative.  If the occlusion determination is not sure a given object is
    totally occluded, it should consider an object visible.  A specific occlusion method can
    do "aggressive culling" and remove objects that are possibly or partially visible, but this
    should be noted in the documentation.  Also, the degree of aggressive culling should be
    controllable through some user parameters.

    3. Deterministic.  If I perform an occlusion test on and object, and then do another
    occlusion test on that same object, it should return the same result unless I have modified
    the occlusion state (for instance, by adding another occluder).  However, if I reset the occlusion
    state and add in all the same occluders again, you can return a different result.  This allows
    the use of temporal coherence if you really want it.

 * This visitor doesn't put any spatial bounds on the occluders it will use.  If you
 * only want occluders in a specific region--such as a view frustum--you will have
 * to provide a properly configured nVisibilityVisitor using SetVisibilityVisitor.
 * Then potential occluding objects are checked against the visibilitytest() of 
 * the visibilityvisitor.  The occlusion visitor will tell it's restricting visibility
 * visitor about local space enter/leave events.
