@section Nebula2HagenTutorialSampleSource Sample Source

The sample source code that you can use as a referrence while
reading this tutorial is available under contrib and is structured
as follows:
@verbatim
nebula2/
    code/
        contrib/
            tutorials/
                bldfiles/
                    napplication/
                        nApplicationTutorial.bld
                inc/
                    napplication_tutorial/
                        ntutorialapp.h
                        ntutorialappstate.h
                src/
                    napplication_tutorial/
                        ntutorialapp_main.cc
                        tutorialapp_entry.cc
                        ntutorialappstate_main.cc
                scripts/
                    napplication_tutorial/
                        startup.tcl
@endverbatim
Note that it is structured differently to how you'd structure your own
projects and the reason for that is explained later on. Also, if you want
to try creating the sample application from scratch you'll need to rename
the provided .bld, .h and .cc files to .old to prevent conflicts with
your own files. 


@section Nebula2HagenTutorialCreateNewProject Creating a new project

One way to create a new project in Visual Studio is to use the Project Wizard
to automatically generate the directory structure, and then the Class Wizard 
to create new classes, methods, etc.

This approach is incompatible with Nebula! Nebula classes and methods must be
created by hand in the source and header files, at least with a standard 
Visual Studio configuration.


@subsection Nebula2HagenTutorialCreateNewProjectUpdatePy update.py

To create a new project in Nebula, we use the update.py script. This script 
will search the Nebula2 directory tree for "build files" (.bld), process them,
and output Visual Studio solution (aka workspace) and project files to the 
nebula2/build directory. Note that update.py is cross-platform: the same .bld
file can be used to create projects for various Visual Studio versions, as well
as Linux and MacOS X.

By default the nebula2/code directory contains the subdirectories <i>nebula</i>
and <i>contrib</i>. The <i>nebula</i> subdirectory contains the Nebula core, 
<i>contrib</i> contains code contributed by the Nebula community. When you create
a new project it is recommended you put it in nebula2/code/myprojectname, unless
you're working on code you're planning on contributing, in which case you should 
put it in nebula2/contrib/mycontribution.

Since the source code for this tutorial is a contribution it is located under 
nebula2/code/contrib/tutorials, not directly under nebula2/code. The following
is what you'd need to do if you wanted to create the application from
scratch: 
-# Create an napplication_tutorial subdirectory in nebula2/code.
-# Create the subdirs bldfiles, src, and inc in 
   nebula2/code/napplication_tutorial.
   Nebula project directories are always structured this way.
-# Create the subdir scripts in nebula2/code/napplication_tutorial.
-# Create an napplication_tutorial subdir in both src and inc.
-# In inc/napplication_tutorial, create a text file called ntutorialapp.h, and in 
   src/napplication_tutorial one called ntutorialapp_main.cc.
-# Since we're programming C++ here, and not Java, we need an extra "main" 
   routine: create tutorialapp_entry.cc in your src dir. We don't need a 
   corresponding header.
-# Finally, create a text file called nApplicationTutorial.bld in your bldfiles dir.

If you followed the steps above the resulting directory structure will look 
like this:
@verbatim
nebula2/
    code/
        napplication_tutorial/
            bldfiles/
            inc/
                napplication_tutorial/
            src/
                napplication_tutorial/
            scripts/
@endverbatim


@subsection Nebula2HagenTutorialCreateNewProjectBldFile myProjectName.bld

Now open up the .bld file in a text editor, which we'll use to describe our
solution.

First of all, we define the so-called <i>module</i>. Each module will become a 
subfolder of a project within a Visual Studio solution. Modules are used 
to group closely related source files together.

Usually, each module contains all the files for a single nObject (or one
of its descendants) derived class, and nothing else. However, a module may 
also contain a bunch of classes so long as they don't use 
nNebulaClass/nNebulaScriptClass macros (i.e. they aren't nObject derived). 

We write the following in our build file to define the ntutorialapp module:
@verbatim
beginmodule ntutorialapp
    setdir napplication_tutorial
    setheaders { ntutorialapp }
    setfiles { ntutorialapp_main tutorialapp_entry }
endmodule
@endverbatim

You can see that we omit the .cc and .h extensions, because update.py fills
them in automatically if you don't supply them. It is recommended you follow 
this naming convention (using .cc) for any new code you write. However, if you 
want to create a module from some third party code that uses .c and .cpp 
file extensions you can do so by specifying the extension as part of the 
filename in the bld file.

The next step is to tell update.py what we want our compiled 
"finished product" to be, and how it should be linked. We do this by adding
the following to our bld file:

@verbatim
begintarget tutorialapp_exe
    settype exe 
    setmodules { 
        ntutorialapp
    }
    settargetdeps {
        napplication
        nkernel
        nnebula
        ndinput8
        ndirect3d9
        ndshow
        microtcl
        ngui
        ndsaudioserver3
    }
endtarget
@endverbatim

I've named our target <b>tutorialapp_exe</b>, rather than the more aesthetically 
pleasing <b>tutorialapp</b> so you can clearly distinguish between the module
<b>ntutorialapp</b> and the target <b>tutorialapp_exe</b>.

The last thing we need is the workspace definition - which files from the 
Nebula directory tree should appear and be editable in the Visual Studio 
solution.

It is essential that all targets in the target dependency list also appear 
in the workspace, otherwise you will get linking errors when you try to build
the .sln/.vcproj files for Visual Studio 7 or higher.

It is, however, also possible to include targets in the workspace that are 
not required by the target - for reference.

We add the following to our bld file to define our sample workspace:
@verbatim
beginworkspace nApplicationIntroTutorial
    annotate "Introduction to nApplication tutorial."
    settargets {
        tutorialapp_exe
        napplication
        nkernel
        nnebula
        ndinput8
        ndirect3d9
        ndshow
        microtcl
        ngui
        ndsaudioserver3
    }
endworkspace
@endverbatim

The first target listed in the workspace definition will be the default
target in the resulting Visual Studio solution.

At last! Our build file is complete. Now, save it, and run update.py
(or update.exe if you are using a binary SDK) (in the nebula2 root
directory).  Select your compiler and the workspace that you've
created, and hit the <tt>Run</tt> button.

Additional information about the build system can be found at 
@ref NebulaBuildSystem.


@section Nebula2HagenTutorialSubclassingApplication Subclassing nApplication

So, we have a Visual Studio solution file. Now we need to write our 
application class. As already mentioned, we must do this by hand, not with 
a Visual Studio wizard.

In ntutorialapp.h, we write:

@code
#ifndef N_TUTORIALAPP_H
#define N_TUTORIALAPP_H

#include "application/napplication.h"

class nTutorialApp : public nApplication
{
public:
    nTutorialApp();
    virtual ~nTutorialApp();
};

#endif // N_TUTORIALAPP_H
@endcode

And in ntutorialapp_main.cc:

@code
#include "napplication_tutorial/ntutorialapp.h"
#include "kernel/nkernelserver.h"

nNebulaClass(nTutorialApp, "napplication")

nTutorialApp::nTutorialApp()
{
}

nTutorialApp::~nTutorialApp()
{
}
@endcode

The key here is the special macro nNebulaClass(ClassName, "parentmodule").
This macro declares our application class as a direct extension of Nebula,
which is necessary for it to work correctly. <i>ClassName</i> is just the 
C++ name of the class, and <i>parentmodule</i> is the module name of the
parent class.

As a consequence of this declaration, the application class must also be 
instantiated in a special way. This will be described in the next section.


@section Nebula2HagenTutorialTheMainFunction Putting things together in main()

Now we need to write the standard "main" routine. Its only job is to ensure 
that all nebula components and myAppClass are correctly instantiated on startup
and cleaned up on exit.

The first step is to include a bit of Nebula in ntutorialapp_entry.cc:

@code
#include "kernel/nkernelserver.h"
#include "gfx2/ndisplaymode2.h"
#include "napplication_tutorial/ntutorialapp.h"
@endcode

Now we get to a concept that always confuses beginners: the kernel server. 
Nebula2 is organized in a manner that resembles an operating system. 
Like Linux, it has its own kernel, which can be extended by loading additional 
modules. Before we jump into the main routine and instantiate the kernel server, 
we need to indicate which packages (corresponding to <i>targets</i> in the 
build files; that is, sets of modules) will be used. This is similar to an 
include, but with special Nebula-specific syntax:

@code
NebulaUsePackage(target);
@endcode

Where <i>target</i> is not a filename, but rather the name of the target 
(as specified after a <b>begintarget</b> in a .bld file).
For our example, we want the following:

@code
nNebulaUsePackage(nnebula);
nNebulaUsePackage(ndirect3d9);
nNebulaUsePackage(ndshow);
nNebulaUsePackage(ngui);
nNebulaUsePackage(ndinput8);
nNebulaUsePackage(ndsaudioserver3);
nNebulaUsePackage(napplication);
nNebulaUsePackage(tutorialapp_exe);
@endcode

Now, at last, we can write the main routine, and instantiate our first and 
most important Nebula object, the kernel server, in a perfectly normal way:

@code
void main()
{
    // Kernel Server preparation:
    nKernelServer kernelServer;
@endcode

The next step is to add the packages we want to use to the kernel server, 
using the AddPackage method.

@code
nKernelServer::AddPackage(target);
@endcode

And so, alas, the whole bit one more time:

@code
    kernelServer.AddPackage(nnebula);
    kernelServer.AddPackage(ndirect3d9);
    kernelServer.AddPackage(ndshow);
    kernelServer.AddPackage(ngui);
    kernelServer.AddPackage(ndinput8);
    kernelServer.AddPackage(ndsaudioserver3);
    kernelServer.AddPackage(napplication);
    kernelServer.AddPackage(tutorialapp_exe);
}
@endcode

But we're missing something for a proper "Hello, Nebula2", namely that it 
doesn't yet output anything. Let's fix that:

@code
    n_printf("Go back to sleep, bruce.\n")
@endcode

Now call update.py (as above) one more time, to create the tutorialapp_exe 
package. In Visual Studio, you should see the file pkg_tutorialapp_exe.cc 
in the VC Solution Explorer. This transforms our code into a package.

To get our first reaction from the Nebula system, let's try running the 
program from a command prompt. It should be at nebula2/bin/win32d/tutorialapp_exe.exe.

As we'll see, n_printf is useful for more than ordering bruce around: it's an 
important debugging tool. When we run Nebula in windowed mode, we can display a 
text window (console) in the background, into which Nebula prints status messages. 
You, too, can output to the console (or a log file) using n_printf!

In the next step, we'll instantiate our nTutorialApp. We don't use the normal 
<b>n_new</b> operator for this, nor can we create an nTutorialApp instance on the 
stack. We're dealing with Nebula classes now, and they must be created through 
the kernel server, like so:

@code
    nTutorialApp* theApp = static_cast<nTutorialApp*>(kernelServer.New("ntutorialapp", "theApp"));
@endcode

Now we have a running instance of the Nebula Application Subsystem. This is 
where it gets exciting, because nTutorialApp, as a child of nApplication, has a 
whole lot of functionality for us to play with.

nApplication allows us to create and manage a Nebula program of arbitrary 
complexity using simple, easy-to-understand methods.

First, we open a rendering window, or, if you prefer, take over the full screen.
To do this, we'll need to create another Nebula class, nDisplayMode2, and pass it 
to nTutorialApp. Here's the code:

@code
    nDisplayMode2 myDisplayMode("Window Title", FLAG, posX, posY, width, height, vSynch);
@endcode

"Window Title" will be displayed in the window's title bar.
The FLAG determines some important properties, e.g.
nDisplayMode::Windowed or nDisplayMode::Fullscreen.

So we write:

@code
    nDisplayMode2 disp("HelloWorld!", nDisplayMode2::Windowed, 100, 100, 600, 400, false);
    theApp->SetDisplayMode(disp);
@endcode

There are a few more tasks to take care of before we can open our window.
Perhaps you are starting to feel that this is too much work to initialize an
empty window. Consider though, that nApplication is intended as the foundation for 
entire games, it needs a certain amount of flexibility and hence complexity. 
It will all be worth it in the end.

First, we need to point nTutorialApp to our project directory and a startup script, 
which will be run when nTutorialApp::Open() is called.

@code
    theApp->SetProjectDirectory("path_to_your_project");
    theApp->SetStartupScript("home:data/scripts/startup.tcl");
@endcode

That first line above defines the alias "proj:" to be the path to our project,
which allows us to reference additional files abstractly, as shown in the 
second line. Later, an installer could write the install path to a registry key,
which we would look up for the SetProjectDirectory call and then not have to 
worry about it in the rest of the program.

At this point, we could initialize much more - just take a look at the Set* 
methods in nApplication - but we have everything we need for now. Next comes 
the application class' main loop, which is always the same:

@code
    if (theApp->Open())
    {
        theApp->Run();
    }
    theApp->Close();
    theApp->Release();
@endcode

There is a default startup.tcl at nebula2/data/scripts.

@section Nebula2HagenTutorialStartupTCL startup.tcl

nApplication::Open() tries to call the following script functions one after
the other:
@verbatim
OnStartup
OnGraphicsStartup
OnMapInput
@endverbatim

The Nebula 2 GUI Server also calls these two script functions:
@verbatim
OnGuiServerOpen
OnGuiServerClose
@endverbatim

We can do whatever we like in the script, but the graphics server needs at 
least one essential piece of information: where to find the shader files, and
which shader to use by default. While we're at it, we might at well decide 
where we're going to put our graphics, sound, and game files, for that happy 
day when we actually have some. We describe that directory structure using the 
<b>assign</b> command in OnStartup, which will prevent any path confusion later on.

There is no requirement to use the standard Nebula directory structure (unless
you use Radon Labs Maya Toolkit), but there's no particular reason not to 
either. Check nebula2/export to see how it looks:
- gfxlib contains .n2 files, which create objects or ever characters.
- meshes contains the mesh data files (vertex coordinates, etc.)
- textures contains, well, textures, in tga, bmp, or dds format.
- anims contains animation data for skinned meshes.

Under nebula2/data, we see a shaders folder with subdirectories <b>fixed</b> 
(for older graphics cards) and <b>2.0</b> (for newer ones), both full of .fx 
shader files.

@verbatim
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   OnStartup
#
#   This procedure is called right after application startup. Use it 
#   to initialize Nebula assigns.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
proc OnStartup {} {

    puts "startup.tcl: OnStartup called"

    set oldCwd [psel]
    sel /sys/servers/file2

    # setup assigns
    set proj [.manglepath "proj:"]
    set home [.manglepath "home:"]
    
    .setassign "data"     "$home/data/"
    .setassign "export"   "$proj/export/"  

    .setassign "scripts"  "data:scripts"
    .setassign "physics"  "export:physics/"
    .setassign "meshes"   "export:meshes/"
    .setassign "textures" "export:textures/"
    .setassign "anims"    "export:anims/"
    .setassign "gfxlib"   "export:gfxlib/"
    .setassign "lights"   "export:lightlib/"
    .setassign "levels"   "export:levels/"
    .setassign "sound"    "export:audio/"
    
    sel $oldCwd
}
@endverbatim

<b>sel</b> navigates the Nebula Object Hierarchy the way that <b>cd</b> 
navigates the DOS or UNIX directory tree. Commands executed in a particular
"directory" of the NOH will be handled by the corresponding Nebula object. 
Thus, the <b>.setassign</b> commands above will be handled by some Nebula object 
called "file2" at /sys/servers/. What is this "file2"? It's the <i>file server</i>.

Nebula works through a diverse collection of so-called <i>servers</i>, each of 
which offers a particular kind of functionality to our application (similiar 
to BEOS). One of these servers is the file server, which is created automatically
by the kernel server, and which, amongst other things, is responsible for managing 
path aliases (in the actual file system, not the NOH). The <b>setassign</b> calls 
above, therefore, allow us to use "meshes:", "textures:", etc. in the same way as 
"proj:".

Nebula's nDirect3d9 server has to know where to find its shaders in order to work,
as noted earlier. We don't want it to fiddle with physical paths, though, so it 
just always tries to use the "shaders:" directory.  Therefore, we need to ensure 
that "shaders:" actually points somewhere, as we will do in OnGraphicsStartup.

@verbatim
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   OnGraphicsStartup
#
#   This method is called right after graphics is initialized.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
proc OnGraphicsStartup {} {

    set oldCwd [psel]
    sel /sys/servers/file2

    if {[exists /sys/servers/gfx]} {
        set featureSet [/sys/servers/gfx.getfeatureset]
        if {$featureSet == "dx9"} {
            # DX9 hardware without floating point render targets 
            /sys/servers/scene.setrenderpathfilename "data:shaders/dx9_renderpath.xml"            
        } elseif {$featureSet == "dx9flt"} {
            # DX9 hardware with floating point render targets, use HDR render path
            /sys/servers/scene.setrenderpathfilename "data:shaders/dx9hdr_renderpath.xml"
        } else {
            # non-DX9 hardware, use fixed function render path
            /sys/servers/scene.setrenderpathfilename "data:shaders/dx7_renderpath.xml"
        }
    } else {
        /sys/servers/scene.setrenderpathfilename "data:shaders/dx9_renderpath.xml"            
    }

    sel $oldCwd
}
@endverbatim


@section Nebula2HagenTutorialStates States

After initializing our application, and before continuing, we should pause
a moment and examine the nApplication subsystem a bit more closely. How is a
game application constructed?

Usually we're dealing with a real-time simulation that does certain things
every frame and then renders a new image to the screen. Sometimes, though, 
the usual loop is interrupted, e.g. to show a cut scene or the main menu. 
To handle this, nApplication uses <i>states</i>.

In nTutorialApp::Open() (that we'll need to add to ntutorialapp_main.cc/
ntutorialapp.h), 
we set the application's initial state. To create a state, we need a new 
Nebula object, this time derived from nAppState:

-# Add the following to your .bld file:
@verbatim
beginmodule ntutorialappstate
    setdir napplication_tutorial
    setheaders { ntutorialappstate }
    setfiles { ntutorialappstate_main }
endmodule
@endverbatim
-# Enter the new module in the module list (setmodules) for the tutorialapp_exe
   target.
@verbatim
begintarget tutorialapp_exe
    settype exe 
    setmodules { 
        ntutorialapp 
        ntutorialappstate
    }
    settargetdeps {          
        napplication
        nkernel
        nnebula
        ndinput8
        ndirect3d9
        ndshow
        microtcl
        ngui
        ndsaudioserver3
    }
endtarget
@endverbatim
-# Create src/napplication_tutorial/ntutorialappstate_main.cc and 
   inc/napplication_tutorial/ntutorialappstate.h.
-# Create the usual class declaration in these files, don't forget the 
   nNebulaClass(nTutorialAppState, "nappstate") macro in the .cc file.
-# Rerun update.py and reload the Visual Studio solution.
.

Take a look at nAppState now. We inherit three methods, each of which is
called once per frame:

@code
OnFrame();     // for game logic
OnRender3D();  // everything to be rendered in 3D
OnRender2D();  // for the gui
@endcode

We'd like our new state to do something useful. 
Let's make it display a 3-D object.

To help us do this, we use another couple of classes from the 
Application Subsystem: nAppCamera and nGfxObject. Before we can create them 
though, we need to include them.

Put it all together, and what do we get? In ntutorialappstate.h:

@code
#ifndef N_TUTORIALAPPSTATE_H
#define N_TUTORIALAPPSTATE_H

#include "application/nappstate.h"
#include "application/ngfxobject.h"
#include "application/nappcamera.h"

class nTutorialAppState: public nAppState
{
public:
    nTutorialAppState();
    virtual ~nTutorialAppState();
    virtual void OnStateEnter(const nString& prevState);
    virtual void OnRender3D();
    virtual void OnRender2D();
    virtual void OnFrame();
    
protected:
    nGfxObject* world;
    nGfxObject* testObject;
};

#endif // N_TUTORIALAPPSTATE_H
@endcode

Note the pointers to our test object and game world in the protected section.

Next, we implement all this in ntutorialappstate_main.cc:

@code
#include "napplication_tutorial/ntutorialappstate.h"

nNebulaClass(nTutorialAppState, "nappstate");

nTutorialAppState::nTutorialAppState()
{
    this->world = 0;
    this->testObject = 0;
}

nTutorialAppState::~nTutorialAppState()
{
    if (this->testObject)
    {
        n_delete(this->testObject);
        this->testObject = 0;
    }
        
    if (this->world)
    {
        n_delete(this->world);
        this->world = 0;
    }
}

void nTutorialAppState::OnStateEnter(const nString& prevState)
{
 
}

void nTutorialAppState::OnRender3D()
{

}

void nTutorialAppState::OnRender2D()
{
    // empty
}

void nTutorialAppState::OnFrame()
{
    // empty
}

@endcode

Now we implement the OnStateEnter method, which, logically enough, will be 
called right at the beginning. This is where we instantiate and initialize
our <i>testObject</i>.

At the moment, our test object isn't a Nebula class, so we can use <b>n_new</b>
to create it. Afterwards, we tell it the name of the .n2 files that it should
display, and command it to load that.

It is important to note that <i>world</i> also just comes from an ordinary .n2
file, in which a light is created, so that we can see what we're doing.

@code
void nTutorialAppState::OnStateEnter(const nString& prevState)
{
    this->world = n_new(nGfxObject);
    this->world->SetResourceName("gfxlib:stdlight.n2");
    this->world->Load();
    this->testObject = n_new(nGfxObject);
    this->testObject->SetResourceName("gfxlib:examples/torus.n2");
    this->testObject->Load();  
}
@endcode

Last but not least, we tell our nTutorialAppState to render those loaded 
resources in 3D.

@code
void nTutorialAppState::OnRender3D()
{
    this->world->Render();
    this->testObject->Render();
}
@endcode

Look at that! Getting this far may have seemed pretty hard, but when we 
actually get around to *doing* the stuff that we want Nebula to do, it's
a one-line triviality.

However, we still need to add our nTutorialAppSate to our nTutorialApp before
we can build. In the nTutorialApp header file, we add:

@code
protected:
    nTutorialAppState* gameState;
@endcode

and in the .cc, we instantiate gameState in the nTutorialApp::Open method, so 
that our application enters the state upon startup:

@code
bool nTutorialApp::Open()
{
    nApplication::Open();

I hope this tutorial helped you get over the difficult initial stage. You can 
use it as the foundation as you further poke around Nebula. The tutorial is 
designed so that, in addition to getting you going, it also raises a number 
of questions that you can investigate on your own. I suggest you take a closer
look at the helper classes nGfxObject, nAppCamera, and nApplication to see 
exactly how they work.
