@page Nebula2ObtainingWinCVS Obtaining Nebula2 with WinCVS

Obtaining Nebula is fairly easy. We will be using the WinCVS system to
obtain the latest Nebula source code from CVS. You can obtain WinCVS from their
<a href="http://www.wincvs.org/download.html">website</a>. Download the
complete recommended package and not the bare package, the bare one lacks
cvsnt, a vital part of WinCVS.

You will also need Python and wxPython to use Nebula. You can
obtain Python (2.4 or later) from <a href="http://www.python.org/download/"
>here</a>, and wxPython (2.6.1 or later) from
<a href="http://www.wxpython.org/download.php">here</a>.

Installing Python is fairly simple, just follow the onscreen instructions.
wxPython is just as easy, make sure that when the wxPython installation
finishes that you choose to compile it. Simply make sure the checkbox next
to 'Compile' is selected and finish the installation. A command prompt will
popup shortly while wxPython is being compiled.

Start up WinCVS. You will be presented with the following screen:

Head up to the Remote menu and select 'Checkout Module'. The following screen
will appear:

 -# Into the module name box enter: nebula2
 -# Into the local folder to checkout to enter the desired location to
    download Nebula to. For instance I entered E: into this box as E: is 
    my projects drive. Nebula will be downloaded to
    <tt>E:\&lt;module name&gt;</tt>.
    So when I downloaded the sources with WinCVS, it was downloaded to
    <tt>E:\nebula2</tt>
 -# Into the CVSROOT box enter:
    <tt>:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/nebuladevice</tt>

Do not modify any other options.

Once you have entered that information the screen should look like this:

Click OK and WinCVS will proceed to download nebula to the location you
specified. When the download is complete and everything went Ok you will
be presented with the following screen:

@image html WinCVS_4.jpg

The 'CVS exited normally with code 0' means that the Nebula module was
downloaded successfully. If you got a code 1 that means there was a
problem and you will most likely need to go back over the 
settings you entered and make sure there is enough drive space and that you
entered a valid module name, host name, and file path.

Thats it, you now have the Nebula source and are ready to compile it
using Visual Studio.
