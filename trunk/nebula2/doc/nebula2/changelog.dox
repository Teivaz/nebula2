@section Nebula2ChangesMay2005 May 2005 Release
   - The merges with Dec.2004. of Radon Labs including:
      - new HDR renderer (which is the default preview renderer if the graphics
        card can do shader model 2.0 and 16 bit floating point textures)
      - fixed "Shadow disappears on Alt-Enter" bug. 
      - fixed "Textures are not properly unloaded" bug.
      - removed the RefillBuffers stuff in nMesh2, this was a confusing hack
      - nGuiServer::Render() and nConServer::Render() moved to nRpPass::Begin().
        You dont need to explicitly call those functions anymore.
      - You should no longer call nGfxServer2::OpenDisplay()/CloseDisplay() in your
        application, this is now handled inside nSceneServer::Open()/Close (this
        was necessary for the new render path code)
      - Added a RAM filesystem server to Nebula2 
      - Integrated HDR renderer as optional render path (required shader model
        2.0 with fp render targets)
      - added a nGuiColorSliderGroup class 
      - fixes to the display adjustments and scene control windows
      - startup.tcl has been moved to home:data/scripts/starup.tcl 
      - rewrote "render path" implementation and added new features (See 'renderpath'
        directory)
      - Fixed an assertion-bug in the animation subsystem (nAnimation::Group::TimeToIndex())
      - ported everything to DX9.0c 
      - cleaned up resource behaviour when D3D device is lost and restored,
        the nResource class now has methods OnLost() and OnRestored(), where
        subclasses can react accordingly 
      - an nResource object can go into one of several states: Unloaded
        (the object is generally un-initialized), Valid (everything is ok for rendering),
        Lost (the resource is not available because the owner ist currently in a lost
        state), Empty (the resource is available, but depends on external code to 
        fill the resource with valid data -> this replaces the old 
        RefillBuffersMode::NeededNow).
      - Optimized Alt-TAB-behaviour (or generally, when the D3D device has been 
        lost). Previously, all visual resources had been unloaded and reloaded when
        the device has been restored, now resources will only unload/reload when really
        required (which is when the D3D resources are placed in the DEFAULT pool).
      - Added a new deformers including blend shape and skin mesh shape deformer.
   - Many documentation improvements.
   - Many new contributed modules, including:
     - Added nOpenDE, a port of the ODE(Open Dynamics Engine).
     - Added OpenGL graphics system.
     - nSpacialDB for spacial database system.
     - nSignal for signal system.
     - nMaxToolBox, 3DSMax toolkit support.
     - Visual Studio Add-in which allows to easy debugging.
   - Various fixes of the bugs.
