Nebula2 Compile Instructions
============================
15-Mar-03   floh    created
13-Feb-04   leaf    added "out of date" note

NOTE: The text files here are out of date, the latest documentation is within 
the Doxygen generated docs. An online link to the latest compiling docs is here:

http://nebuladevice.sourceforge.net/doc2/doxydoc/nebula2/html/Nebula2Compiling.html

NOTE:

* Please read the release notes first, since a lot has changed in the build process.
* At the moment, Nebula2 only comiles under Win32 with VS.NET.


REQUIRED:

* Win2k or WinXP (other Win32 platforms may work but have not been tested)
* VisualStudio 7 (.NET)
* DirectX 9 SDK (http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx)
* a working Tcl8.4 installation (http://www.scripts.com)


PREPARATIONS:

* put the bin/win32 directory into your path

* make sure the uuidgen.exe is in your path, the easiest way 
  is to run the "Visual Studio .NET Command Prompt" (in the VStudio start menu)
  as your command shell, as this will set up all required paths.

* Verify that VS.NET knows the .cc file extension by checking 
  "Tools->Options->Projects->VC++ Build->C/C++ File Extensions"
  (I think this is enabled by default now).
  
* Under "Tools->Options->Projects->VC++ Directories" make sure
  that the DX9 libs and include directories are before 
  VStudio's lib and include directory paths.
  
* In your system settings, create an environment variable
  named RL_HOME which points to your nebula2 installation
  directory. There should be no spaces in your install path
  (this is not tested and may result in, uhm, "unexpected behaviour").
  
  Make sure you use forward slashes. E.g.:
  
  Name:  RL_HOME
  Value: c:/nebula2
  
  
CREATING THE BUILD FILES:

* In the command line, go to code/nebula2/src and type

    tclsh84 update.tcl
    
  This should generate VStudio7 project and solution files in the code/vstudio directory.
   

COMPILING:

* double click the file /code/nebula2/vstudio/tools.sln

* in VStudio, do a "Rebuild Solution", this will compile the Nebula executables
  into the /bin/win32 directory

TESTING:

* double click the nviewer.exe or nsh.exe programs for a first test

* In /export/gfxlib/examples, do a "nviewer -view torus.n2", this should display
  a bumpy shiny donut (hit '1' to switch to 1024x768 fullscreen).

* The schwirl.n2 sample is a quick'n'dirty vertex skinning demo, forgive the
  shitty animation and uv mapping.

* Note that the samples will not look very impressive unless you have
  a graphics card that can do vertex and pixel shaders 1.1 (GForce3 and up,
  but not GForce4MX, ATI Radeon 8500 and up). On lesser hardware the 
  specular lighting will not work.
  
* If you experience stuttering in windowed mode, try switching to
  fullscreen mode (Alt-Enter, or '1' for a higher resulotion), this seems to 
  fix the problem.

* The DX9 HLSL shader files are in /export/shaders/dx9
 
-Floh.
